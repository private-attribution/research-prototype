# Contributing to IPA

IPA is a proposal in the [Private Advertising Technology Community Group
(PATCG)](https://patcg.github.io/) in the [W3C](https://w3.org/).

As this project is created to support and inform a standardization process in
the W3C, we request that contributors making substantive contributions
acknowledge and agree to [W3C
policies](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/) regarding
contributions to a W3C community group.  Contributors to this project are
required to adhere to these commitments in making contributions to this project.

In particular, the W3C policies ultimately require that any intellectual
property be licensed by contributors on a royalty-free basis.  Encumbered
technology that requires payment will not be accepted by this project.  We
require contributors making a contribution to disclose any relevant intellectual
property that they are aware of, in addition to adhering to the commitments they
agree to under the [W3C community contributor license
agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/).  The [W3C patent
policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/) can be referenced for more
information.

We also expect and require that contributors follow the [W3C code of ethics and
professional conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).
